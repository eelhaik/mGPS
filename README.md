# mapping-bacteria - mGPS
Machine learning approach for geographic predictions of environmental samples based on bacterial abundance. 

This repositry contains all code used for data cleaning, modelling and alaysing/plotting the results contained in the mGPS paper. The paper in question outlines the method used for devoping our multi-output model for prediction of location class target (continent/country/city) and location co-ordinates(latitude + longitude) using bacterial abundance data as input. The approach used is a variation on chained regrssors/classifiers (https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/pubs/chains.pdf) (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-016-5546-z).
